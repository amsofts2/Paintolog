                <h2>What is Paintolog?</h2>
                <p>Paintolog is an innovative platform designed to serve as a bridge for children to explore their creativity and emotional world. Drawings are one of the most natural and expressive ways for children to communicate their inner thoughts. We embarked on this journey to understand these expressions more deeply, assist families, and help them connect better with their children.</p>
                <p>Alongside artificial intelligence, Paintolog is developed with the collaboration of expert psychologists, child development specialists, and technology teams. It analyzes children's drawings to provide insights into their emotional, cognitive, and social development. We believe that every line, color, and shape carries meaning, and we interpret these through scientific methods.</p>
